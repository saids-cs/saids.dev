## ⚙️ Development Process (If you wish to modify the styles)

If you plan to modify the `.SCSS` files, you will need to compile the code to CSS.

1.	**REQUIREMENT:** [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/install/) must be installed.
	```bash
	npm install -g sass
	```		

2.	**Compile and watch the changes:** Run the following command. This will make the Sass watch your `scss/` folder and compile automaticly the `style.css` file inside `css` every time you save a change:
	```bash
	sass --watch scss/style.scss:css/style.css
	```
